# Simple-ANN-from-Scratch
It is seen that people can train a neural network using some framework but they struggle to understand the mathematics associated with it. In this repo we will first understand the mathematics behind the working of a neural network and then train a neural network from scratch using the bare minimum mathematics required. The programming language we are going to use is python, however the same can be done in any object oriented language. We will be using the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) [2] detector dataset for the classification, where we will differentiate between the signal and the background noise on the basis of some feature
