# Simple-ANN-from-Scratch
One of the major problems in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is the use of machine learning model
as a black box, even though it might be helpful in a few cases but understanding the internal structure
and the operating mechanism will assist the user to tweak the variables in a more efficient and productive
manner. It will also help the user to develop a more problem specific neural architecture consistent with
their requirement. In this paper we have introduced the working of an artificial neural network (ANN)
by taking the example of a three layered neural network. The entire mathematics behind the working of
neural network along with the different evaluation metrics required to assess the performance of the model
are discussed in this paper. We have also created a custom neural network from scratch and compared it
with the keras based model on three different datasets - susy dataset, cardiovascular dataset, churn
dataset.
